# A todo app

This project has been forked off one of my own tiny boilerplate for react projects. <b>All code is 100% owned and written by me.</b>

Pulled 2 all nighters to do this since I don't get time during the day as much because of my current job.

Run `npm run start` on the project root directory.
Access the demo at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` on your local host.
